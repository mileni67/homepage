## Description
The Movies Browser app provides a platform for exploring both films and individuals within the cinematic realm. Its inception stemmed from a Figma-inspired visual design. Information pertaining to movies and personalities is sourced from an external API known as [**The Movie Database**](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The Movie Browser application is the final project of the Frontend Developer course in YouCode.
